# YorkToolkit
This will calculate your grade based on a text file

You must make a file with a copy and paste from the york unofficial transcript (for classes with grades)

The program can be downloaded here!
https://github.com/AllenKaplan/YorkToolkit/blob/master/out/artifacts/Sandbox_jar/Sandbox.jar

Ise ```java -jar Sandbox.jar```

The program uses regex to find the pasted data groups. It then creates course objects which are stored under a courses object that a student would have. 

Included in the source code is launcher.java for testing.

Enjoy!
